# Module 6  World Weather Analysis
### by Terra Lasho 

## Summary: 
For this project I utilized OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps and Directions API in order to generate 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes. From this, I searched and created a dataframe of cities, with other pertinent weather, travel, and hotel information.  Finally, I created marker layer maps, with directions for a specific itinerary.

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data / Weather_Database folder with the following:
```
Weather_Database.ipynb 
```
```
WeatherPy_Database.csv
```

## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map / The Vacation_Search folder with the following:
```
Vacation_Search.ipynb file
```
```
WeatherPy_vacation.csv file
```
